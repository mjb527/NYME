The New York Mock Exchange was created to give users the abililty to gain real world experience and knowledge of investing and trading while working with real time data and not having to fear losing a their own money. We used APIS from chart.js and twelvedata to pull stock data and put into functional charts for users to access and study data. We also implemented bootstrap and font awesome to make a responsive website.

API Keys can be found here:
